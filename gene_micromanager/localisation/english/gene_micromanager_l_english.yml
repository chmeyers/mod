edict_gene_micromanager:0 "Biological Trait Micromanager"
edict_gene_micromanager_desc:0 "Pops will be automatically modified to optimize them for the job that they are working while respecting the maximum trait limits and researched tech limitations. Genetic/Cybernetic traits will only be added/removed if you have unlocked the associated ascension. Each pop will be evaluated approximately once per decade. Habitability will be changed to match the planet on which they live if glandular acclimation has been researched and it would improve their habitability. Certain rare habitablity traits such as Tomb or Habitat habitability will not be automatically removed. Traits from other ascension paths, such as Psionic, will not be touched."
